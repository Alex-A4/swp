    * @remark
    * Zero is useful for local data with just a few items, but a higher value should be used when a single character search could match a few thousand items.
    * @example
    * In this example search starts after typing 2 characters.
    * <pre>

    * @remark
    * A zero-delay makes sense for local data (more responsive), but can produce a lot of load for remote data, while being less responsive.
    * Value is set in milliseconds.
    * @example
    * In this example search will start after 1s delay.
    * <pre>
    *    <Controls.Input.Suggest searchDelay="{{1000}}" searchParam="city"/>
